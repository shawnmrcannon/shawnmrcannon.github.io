      Hello, and welcome to my page! This is s simple webpage to display a few of the skills I have picked up over the last six weeks thanks to the new pilot program at Ford Motor Credit. I grew up in Colorado Springs and am a second-generation Ford Motor Credit employee in my family. I graduated from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs with a degree in Philosophy focusing on Art and Humanities. During my time at UCCS, I tutored symbolic logic and was a co-president of the <a href="https://scribe.uccs.edu/philosophy-club-plan-for-future/">Philosophy club.</a> I enjoy cooking, gaming, traveling when there isnt a pandemic, and spending time with my family. </p>

<h2>To code or not to code?</h2>
    <p id="myCodeWriting">
      One may ask, why does a Philosophy major wish to become a coder? Well, a degree in philosophy has served me in many aspects of my life. The skills I gained from that education includes being able to have an interesting conversation with almost anyone and, more importantly, great critical thinking skills which can apply to any career path. For example, the skills needed to master the basic foundations of Symbolic Logic go hand in hand with codding. Lastly, there is something to be said about philosophical concepts sought after by the cutting-edge software engineers. Abstract concepts such as morality and consciousness tends to keep cropping up in the realm of technology and software design. While machine learning and deep learning systems are still a mystery to me, there is something to be said about knowing how little you know. However, my desire to code goes beyond an interesting connectio to an ivory tower degree. I had always wanted to go into codding since I first started teaching myself HTML as a child.  Yet, when I went to a teacher to ask for advise on how to start working towards making websites, software, and shaping the future of the internet, I was told that there was no future in codding. Small and impressionable I gave up on my dream of becoming a software engineer. We now live in a world which demands talented and creative coders. I believe that my talents and passion will be well placed in this role.
