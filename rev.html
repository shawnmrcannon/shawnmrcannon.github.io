<h1>Changes</h1>
 
    <div id="Rev-box"><p> For this project I chose to ask Allison, previously mentioned, what changes I could make. Allison and I both enjoy finding new meales to try out. When I first approached her with the chicken marsala recipe page payout we reflected on how annoying it can be to attmept to navigate the layout of the page. Going back and forth on a long list of instructions is not helpful for when we are actually cooking. So, I abandooned the layout that is normally found on recipe pages, and opted for a box containing the steps of the recipe with a horizontal scroll bar. This made a layout which allows veiwers to see the listed ingredients and the step by step guid simultaniously. I also opted for a more plain background to make for easier reading, and created a border that is a little more simple to create a cleaner page experience.</p>

    <div id="rev-box-two"> <p> I was very impressed with the banner that was created on the sample site made by Kyle. I wanted to create a similar banner, but with an image of my brother's beautiful sunflower forest. However, Allison pointed out that the image was unnable to remain static and would change with the size of the browser window. Rather than keeping it as "behind" the HTML I opted to place it behind the body element. This not only made a much cleaner outline for the main body box, it also put it in a container which stopped it from being manipulated by the wondow size! </p> <img src="images/backndbring.jpg" alt="stale page"></div>

    <div id="rev-box-three"><p>Lastely, Allison pointed out how boring my navigation bar was. We remembered that part of what makes a great site or application so enjoyable is how it is  and more than simple lines and text. So I took the old navigation bar, turned them into buttons, and even made the color change. This creates a unique interaction on the site that can make it stand out from those similar to it.</p> <img src="images/navbar.jpg" alt="old nav bar"></div>
