<p> I have chosen two recipes to share on my page. The first is going to be a delicious chicken marsala recipe. I learned this recipe from my step-father Martin, and have added a few optional steps below the easy to follow steps. It is best served with pasta, rice or mashed potatoes. It is best paired with a dry red wine or a whiskey. I have also included the recipe for the "Midnight Mule." This is not recomended to be paired with your meal. Rather, it is a pleasent after dinner cocktail. This is a spin on the classic moscow mule which my significant other came up with herself. The ingredients brands do not matter, and I have included an images to assist you. Enjoy!</p>

        This Chicken Marsala recipe is straight forward and simple. You can follow the steps above and create a wonderful dish! However, I added five optional steps and advise to make your dinner feel like it is served at a five-star restaurant;
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style: upper-roman;">
            <li>If you want your sauce to be a bit thicker, you can add 2 teaspoons of corn starch during the thickening process, at the risk of loosing a little flavor. It is important to whisk corn starch thoroughly to create a thick sauce without clumps.</li>
            <li>You can also add a liquor to your sauce to give it an extra kick. It is recommended to use a dry red wine or whiskey.</li>
            <li>This dish is best served this pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes. I find that the mashed potatoes offer a great complement to the overall texture and taste of the sauce. There is also the added benefit of having already opened a heavy whipping cream. The remaining cream from a half pint container is just enough to add to your potatoes to make them nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li>You may have noticed a little extra green in our final product. This is a bit of spinach that is lightly sautaed and salted. You can add the spinach if you desire some vegitables with your marsala.</li>
            <li>The easiest step to miss in this process is adding thyme. If you forget that your marsala will be lacking in flavor. Much like in coding; sometimes missing a seemingly insignificant step can have disappointing results.</li>
        </ul>

    <p style="font-size: smaller;">**Concerning mule ingredients: If you are unnable to find "Moanin syrup,"" look at your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=restaurant+supply+store+near+me&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHh_nl1sH1AhVVJjQIHVPjDE4QuzF6BAgBEAI&biw=1452&bih=736&dpr=1.25">local kitchen supply store</a>, there is bound to be a lavander syrup you can use there. Ginger beer is a non-achoolic mixer. I would not recomend drinking it alone. I highly recomend to find the ginger beer that is best for you. Fever tree is my personal favorite because of it's tolerable carbination and extra spice. That being said, it is a carbonated drink do not attempt to add shake. Similarly, there are other blackberry moonshine apart from 'Old Smokey.' Allison and I wish you the best of luck in making this drink your own!</p>
